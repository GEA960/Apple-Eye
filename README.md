Statement of the Problem

Our ideal situation is to have every student in the country a good quality of education as well as enough financial support to provide the needs of every student, but we found out that even though there are no tuition fees in state universities and colleges, students still have difficulties in their financial needs. One of the situation and problem that we saw and experienced here in our region is that the hassle and very time consuming in passing scholarship requirements that can cause accident like stampede. It is also hard for some students to look for organizations that will help to support their financial needs.

Solution
Thatâ€™s why we create a web application namely ApplEYE (apply) that will help the students look for every scholarship opportunities in there respected cities, for them to lessen their financial problems, to have a convenient time, and to avoid accident like stampede.
Through this web application, student who wants to look for financial assistance can find a provider, this also includes the requirements to be complied, the application form and schedule of examination. The scholarship providers can also notify the applicants through this application. It will be more convenient for the students to find financial assistance.
Enough financial support will help the students engage more in learning their field that will be needed by the country in the future
